\section*{\sffamily \Large Results with constant permitivitty}

\subsection*{\sffamily \large Convergence of a spherical cavity}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Show convergence to analytical solution for
    \begin{itemize}
        \item BEM-BEM
        \item Standard FEM-BEM
        \item Hybrid FEM-BEM
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\sffamily \large Performance for a molecular geometry}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use arginine or a small protein (1PGB?)
    \item Compare computer time and iterations for FEM-BEM with standard and hybrid approaches, without preconditioner. Choose hybrid.
    \item Show performance of hybrid method with preconditioner.
\end{itemize}

\section*{\sffamily \Large Results with variable permittivity}

\subsection*{\sffamily \large Validation for a spherical cavity}

Compare solvation energy results of hybrid FEM-BEM with Delphi

\subsection*{\sffamily \large Convergence and performance for a molecular geometry}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mesh refinement study using hybrid FEM-BEM and Delphi (if possible) on arginine or small protein. Check if they are converging to same result.
    \item Compare timings for equivalent error (if possible)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\sffamily \large Performance analysis for larger structures}

For a given mesh refinement, show solvation energy and timings using preconditioned hybrid FEM-BEM up to the biggest problem we can do on whatever computer we're using.
